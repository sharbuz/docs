# Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the AI/Run CodeMie application to {props.clusterName} and related {props.cloudProvider} services. By following these instructions, you will:

- Get along with AI/Run CodeMie architecture
- Deploy {props.cloudProvider} infrastructure using Terraform
- Configure and deploy all AI/Run CodeMie application components

## How to Use This Guide

For successful deployment, please follow these steps in sequence:

1. First, verify all prerequisites and set up your {props.cloudProvider} environment accordingly. Next, deploy the required infrastructure using Terraform.
2. Finally, deploy and configure the AI/Run CodeMie components on {props.clusterName} cluster.
3. Complete platform configuration using the Configuration section.

Each section contains detailed instructions to ensure a smooth deployment process. The guide is structured to walk you through from initial setup to a fully functional AI/Run CodeMie environment on {props.cloudProvider}.
