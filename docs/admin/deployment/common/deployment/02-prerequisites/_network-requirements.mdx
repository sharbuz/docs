## Network Requirements

### Outbound Connectivity

Your {props.clusterName} cluster's {props.networkSecurityName} must allow **outbound access** to the following endpoints:

| Destination                           | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `europe-west3-docker.pkg.dev`         | AI/Run CodeMie container registry (Google Container Registry)  |
| `quay.io`                             | Third-party container images                                   |
| `docker.io`                           | Docker Hub container images                                    |
| `registry.developers.crunchydata.com` | PostgreSQL operator images                                     |
| Your integration services             | GitLab, GitHub, or other services you plan to use with CodeMie |

:::note Container Registry Access
AI/Run CodeMie container images are hosted on Google Container Registry (GCR). You will need **gcloud CLI** installed on your deployment machine to authenticate and pull helm charts from GCR.
:::

### Inbound Connectivity on Corporate Services

If you plan to integrate AI/Run CodeMie with external corporate services (e.g., GitLab, GitHub, internal APIs):

- Configure the **firewall on your external service** to allow inbound traffic from the AI/Run CodeMie {props.natGatewayName} public IP address
- This allows AI/Run CodeMie to make outbound API calls to your external services (e.g., GitLab API, GitHub API, internal services)

:::warning
The AI/Run CodeMie {props.natGatewayName} public IP address will only be available **after infrastructure deployment**. You will need to configure external service firewalls after the installation is complete.
:::

### Access Control Network List

To restrict access to AI/Run CodeMie and prevent unauthorized access from the public internet, prepare a list of allowed networks:

- **Corporate network CIDR ranges** from which users will access AI/Run CodeMie
- **VPN network ranges** if remote users connect via VPN
- **Office locations** and their public IP addresses or CIDR blocks
- **Any other trusted networks** that require access to the platform
