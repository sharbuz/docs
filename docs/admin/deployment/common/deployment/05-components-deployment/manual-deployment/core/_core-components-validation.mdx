## Post-Installation Validation

After completing all core component installations, verify the following:

```bash
# All core components are running
kubectl get pods -n codemie | grep -E "(mcp-connect|mermaid|codemie-ui|codemie-api)"

# Check all deployments
kubectl get deployments -n codemie

# Check all services
kubectl get services -n codemie

# Verify ingress is configured
kubectl get ingress -n codemie

# Check overall namespace status
kubectl get all -n codemie
```

All checks should return successful results before proceeding.

## Next Steps

Once core components are deployed and verified, proceed to **[Observability](./observability)** installation to deploy logging and monitoring infrastructure.
