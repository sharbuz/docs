This guide covers the installation of foundational infrastructure components that provide storage provisioning and external access to your AI/Run CodeMie deployment.

## Overview

This step installs two critical infrastructure components:

- **Nginx Ingress Controller** - Routes external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster
- **{props.storageClassName}** - Enables dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes for stateful workloads

:::info When to Skip
If your {props.clusterName} cluster already has an ingress controller and storage class configured, you can skip the relevant sections and proceed to [Data Layer](./data-layer).
