## Post-Installation Validation

After completing this step, verify the following:

```bash
# Ingress controller is running
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx | grep Running

# Load balancer has IP assigned
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx-controller

# Storage class is available
kubectl get storageclass
```

All checks should return successful results before proceeding.

## Next Steps

Once storage and ingress are configured, proceed to **[Data Layer](./data-layer)** installation to deploy Elasticsearch, Kibana, and PostgreSQL components.
