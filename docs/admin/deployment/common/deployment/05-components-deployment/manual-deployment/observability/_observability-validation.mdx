## Post-Installation Validation

After completing observability stack installation, verify the following:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`# Fluent Bit is running on all nodes
kubectl get daemonset -n fluentbit
kubectl get pods -n fluentbit

# Kibana is running

kubectl get pods -n elastic | grep kibana
kubectl get deployment -n elastic kibana

# Check Kibana is accessible

curl -k ${props.kibanaUrl}`}

</CodeBlock>

All checks should return successful results.
