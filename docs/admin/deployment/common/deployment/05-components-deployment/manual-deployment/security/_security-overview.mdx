This guide covers the installation of authentication and authorization components that provide secure access control for AI/Run CodeMie.

## Overview

The security layer consists of three components:

- **Keycloak Operator** - Kubernetes operator for managing Keycloak lifecycle
- **Keycloak** - Identity and access management (IAM) system providing authentication, authorization, and user management
- **OAuth2 Proxy** - Authentication proxy that secures application endpoints by integrating with Keycloak

:::info Installation Order
These components must be installed in the order presented. Keycloak requires the operator, and OAuth2 Proxy requires Keycloak to be running.
