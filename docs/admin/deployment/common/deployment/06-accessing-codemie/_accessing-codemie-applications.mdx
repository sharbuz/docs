Once deployment is complete and validated, access the AI/Run CodeMie applications:

## Application URLs

Instead of `example.com` use domain name configured during infrastructure deployment:

| Application        | URL                                                 | Description                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **CodeMie UI**     | http(s)://codemie.example.com                       | Main user interface              |
| **CodeMie API**    | http(s)://codemie.example.com/code-assistant-api/v1 | REST API endpoint                |
| **Keycloak Admin** | <span>{props.keycloakUrl}</span>                    | Identity management console      |
| **Kibana**         | <span>{props.kibanaUrl}</span>                      | Data visualization and analytics |

:::info Protocol and Domain

- **HTTP vs HTTPS**: Private clusters typically use HTTP. Public deployments should use HTTPS with valid TLS certificates.
- **Domain Name**: Use configured during infrastructure deployment (`CODEMIE_DOMAIN_NAME` in `deployment_outputs.env`)
- **Private DNS**: If using private DNS, ensure your client machine can resolve the domain (VPN or internal network required)
