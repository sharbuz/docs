description: Assigning roles and attributes to users
---

This section is a **mandatory** follow-up step for any user created in Part 1. Here, you will grant users permissions to access the platform and its projects.

The system has three main access levels:

1. **Platform Administrator (`admin` role):** Global access to everything. This is a standalone role.
2. **Project Administrator (`developer` role + `applications` & `applications_admin` attributes):** Full administrative rights within specific projects. This level includes all Standard User permissions.
3. **Standard User (`developer` role + `applications` attribute):** Standard rights within specific projects.
