| Elasticsearch       | 2                        | 16Gi  | 4.0  | 100-200 Gb per pod |
| Kibana              | 1                        | 1Gi   | 1.0  | –                  |
| Mermaid-server      | 1                        | 512Mi | 1.0  | –                  |
| PostgreSQL          | Managed service in cloud |       |      | 30-50 Gb           |
| Keycloak + DB       | 1 + 1                    | 4Gi   | 2.0  | 1 Gb               |
| Oauth2-proxy        | 1                        | 128Mi | 0.1  | –                  |
| NATS + Auth Callout | 1 + 1                    | 512Mi | 1.0  | –                  |
| MCP Connect         | 1                        | 1Gi   | 0.5  | –                  |
| Fluentbit           | daemonset                | 128Mi | 0.1  | –                  |
| LLM Proxy\*         | 1                        | 1Gi   | 1.0  | –                  |

\* Depends on the exact LLM proxy type

## Infrastructure Components

The AI/Run CodeMie deployment on AWS includes the following main infrastructure components:

### Compute

- **Amazon EKS Cluster**: Managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**: Automatically adjusts compute capacity for the EKS cluster

### Networking

- **VPC**: Isolated network environment
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming HTTPS traffic to application services
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Handles TCP traffic for NATS messaging system
- **NAT Gateway**: Provides outbound internet connectivity for private subnets
- **Route 53**: DNS service with automatically provisioned records

### Storage

- **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL**: Managed relational database service
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for application data and artifacts
- **EBS Volumes**: Persistent block storage for Kubernetes pods

### Security

- **AWS KMS**: Key Management Service for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data
- **IAM Roles**: Granular permissions for services and components
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: Automated SSL/TLS certificate management for ALB and NLB
- **Security Groups**: Network-level access control

### Optional Features

- **Internal ALB**: For private network communication when enabled
- **Private DNS Hosted Zone**: For internal service discovery
