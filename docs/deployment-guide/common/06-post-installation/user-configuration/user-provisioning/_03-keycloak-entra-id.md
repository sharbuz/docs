If your organization uses Microsoft Entra ID, you can configure it as an Identity Provider in Keycloak. This will allow users to sign in to AI/Run CodeMie with their corporate credentials.

The process is divided into two main stages: configuring the application in Azure, and then connecting it to Keycloak.

## Stage 1: Entra ID Configuration

### 1. Navigate to App Registrations

Log in to the Azure portal, go to `Microsoft Entra ID`, and select `App registrations` from the `Manage` side menu.

![App Registrations](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-13-54.png)

### 2. Create New Registration

Click `New registration`. Provide a descriptive **Name** (e.g., `AI/Run CodeMie Keycloak Integration`), and click `Register`. You can leave the "Redirect URI" blank for now.

### 3. Create Client Secret

From the app's side menu, navigate to `Certificates & secrets` and click `New client secret`.

![New Client Secret](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-29-40.png)

### 4. Save the Client Secret Value

Give the secret a **Description** (e.g., `Keycloak Secret`) and click `Add`.

![Secret Description](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-33-15.png)

![Copy Secret](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-34-3.png)

:::warning Important: Copy the Secret Value Immediately
The client secret `Value` is only visible once, immediately after creation. Copy it and save it in a secure location; you will need it for the Keycloak configuration.
:::

### 5. Verify API Permissions

Navigate to the `API permissions` tab. Ensure that the `User.Read` permission for `Microsoft Graph` (Type: `Delegated`) is present. This is usually added by default.

![Permissions List](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-36-44.png)

_Keep the Azure portal tab open, as you will need to return to it._

## Stage 2: Keycloak Configuration

This stage involves connecting your Entra ID application to Keycloak and automating permission assignment for new users.

### 1. Add the Identity Provider

First, in your `codemie-prod` realm, navigate to `Identity Providers` and select **OpenID Connect v1.0**.

![Identity Providers](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-40-46.png)

![OpenID Connect](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-41-19.png)

### 2. Configure the Provider Details

Before filling in the fields, gather the required information from your Azure app registration.

:::info Where to Find Your Azure Details
In the Azure portal, navigate to your app registration:

1. The **Application (client) ID** is available on the main **Overview** page.
2. Click on **Endpoints** to find the **OpenID Connect metadata document** URL.
3. The **Client Secret Value** is the one you copied and saved in Stage 1.
   :::

![Application ID](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-53-20.png)

![Endpoints](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-59-40.png)

![Metadata URL](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_3-53-47.png)

Now, fill in the following fields on the Keycloak page and click `Add`:

- **Alias:** A unique name for this provider (e.g., `entra-id`).
- **Discovery endpoint:** Paste the `OpenID Connect metadata document` URL from Azure.
- **Client ID:** Paste the `Application (client) ID` from Azure.
- **Client Secret:** Paste the client secret `Value` you saved in Stage 1.

### 3. Configure the Redirect URI

This step creates the secure link between Keycloak and your Azure app.

**Copy the Redirect URI from Keycloak:** After adding the provider, Keycloak will display a **Redirect URI** at the top of its configuration page. Copy this value.

![Copy Redirect URI](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_4-19-2.png)

**Add a Web Platform in Azure:** Go back to your Azure app registration, select the **Authentication** tab, click **Add a platform**, and then select **Web**.

![Authentication Tab](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_4-20-13.png)

![Add Platform](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_4-21-19.png)

![Select Web](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_4-21-40.png)

**Paste the URI and Save:** In the "Redirect URIs" field, paste the URI you copied from Keycloak and click **Configure**.

### 4. Automate Permissions with Mappers

:::warning Critical: Mappers are Required for a Functional Setup
This step is mandatory. Without these mappers, new users who sign in via SSO will be created in Keycloak but **will not be able to access the platform** because they won't have the necessary role and project attributes assigned automatically.
:::

Mappers automate the permission assignment process described in ASK Part 2 by granting default permissions to every new user during their first sign-in.

---

**Mapper 1: Assign Default Role (Required)**

This mapper automatically assigns the `developer` role to all new SSO users. For more details, see [Step 2.1: Assign a Role](../user-authorization/assign-roles).

Navigate to the **Mappers** tab from your Identity Provider's configuration page.

![Mappers Tab](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_5-35-59.png)

Click **Add mapper** to open the configuration form.

![Add Mapper](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_5-36-28.png)

Configure and save the mapper: Fill in the fields with the following values and then click **Save**:

- **Name:** `codemie-developer-role`
- **Sync Mode Override:** `Import`
- **Mapper Type:** `Hardcoded Role`
- **Role:** Select the `developer` role from the list.

---

**Mapper 2: Assign Default Project (Required)**

This mapper automatically creates a personal project for each new user. For more details, see [Step 2.2: Assign Attributes](../user-authorization/assign-attributes).

Navigate back to the **Mappers** tab and click **Add mapper** again.

Configure and save the mapper: Fill in the fields with the following values and click **Save**:

- **Name:** `codemie-attribute`
- **Sync Mode Override:** `Import`
- **Mapper Type:** `Attribute Importer`
- **Claim:** `email`
- **User Attribute Name:** `applications`

---

### 5. Grant Admin Consent and Verify the Integration

This final step confirms that everything is working correctly. To complete it, you must perform the first login using an **Azure Administrator account**.

**Initiate the First Sign-In:** Navigate to the AI/Run CodeMie login page and click the button to sign in with your Entra ID provider.

![SSO Login](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_4-58-57.png)

**Authenticate with Microsoft:** Sign in using your Azure Administrator credentials.

**Provide Admin Consent for the Organization:** Microsoft will display a "Permissions requested" dialog. You **must** check the box labeled **"Consent on behalf of your organization"** before clicking **Accept**.

![Admin Consent](@site/docs/deployment-guide/common/images/user-configuration/image-2025-9-19_5-0-18.png)

**Confirm Successful Login:** After accepting, you should be successfully logged in, confirming that the SSO integration and mappers are working correctly.

:::note Next Step: Fine-Grained Permissions
All new users who sign in via SSO will now be automatically created and granted the default `developer` role and a personal project. To grant them additional permissions (like Project Administrator access or access to other shared projects), you can now find them in the Keycloak user list and proceed to [Part 2: User Authorization](../user-authorization/assign-attributes) to manage their attributes manually.
