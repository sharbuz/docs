# AI TestMate

AI TestMate is an autonomous GenAI solution for automatic unit-test generation that works as a "virtual teammate" within the SDLC: it analyzes repositories, creates and commits tests without manual intervention, helping quickly increase coverage and reduce team effort. It uses an ensemble of LLM models, an agentic approach, and a secure proxy access layer to the models.
