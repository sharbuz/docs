# 3.13 Share Assistant Chat with Other Users

You can easily share your assistant chat conversations with team members or colleagues by following these steps:

1. Locate the chat you want to share.

2. In the open chat click the **Share Chat** button.

3. Recipients who open the link will be able to view the entire chat conversation in read-only mode, meaning they can see all the content but cannot add new messages or modify existing ones.

:::note
As the creator of the chat, you retain full control over your conversation. You can still edit or delete the chat through the same context menu, even after sharing it.

## Managing Your Shared Chats

- Editing a shared chat: Click the context menu (⋮) and select **Edit**. Any changes you make will be visible to everyone with the link.

- Deleting a shared chat: Click the context menu (⋮) and select **Delete**. This will remove access for everyone with the link.

- No expiration: Shared links do not expire automatically, so users with the link can access the chat until you delete it.

## Use Cases for Chat Sharing

- Share problem-solving approaches with your team

- Distribute AI-generated code snippets to collaborators

- Share research findings or summaries with stakeholders

- Use as reference material for documentation or training

- Demonstrate assistant capabilities to new team members
