# HTML Preview

If you ask an AI/Run CodeMie assistant to generate an HTML code, you might want to see a quick preview of the code. For this purpose, the HTML Preview function was added to AI/Run CodeMie. The distinguishing characteristic of this tool is that it is offered out of the box. You can quickly preview the resulting code by clicking the **Preview** button:
