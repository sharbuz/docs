# Publish to Marketplace

Share your custom assistants with the AI/Run CodeMie community by publishing them to the Marketplace. Follow the publishing process to ensure your assistant is properly configured and secure.

## Publishing Process

1. Create and configure your assistant in the **Project Assistants** section.

2. Click the **Publish to Marketplace** button on your assistant card:

3. The system will validate your assistant for publishing eligibility.

## Credential Policies

### Personal/Project Credential Detection

Before publishing, the system checks for sensitive credentials:

![Credential warning modal](../images/image12.png)

- If your assistant uses personal or project-specific credentials, a warning modal will appear
- The modal guides you through the process and prevents accidental credential exposure
- You must review and confirm before proceeding with publication

:::warning Credential Security
Always review credential warnings carefully. Publishing assistants with personal credentials may expose sensitive information to other users.
