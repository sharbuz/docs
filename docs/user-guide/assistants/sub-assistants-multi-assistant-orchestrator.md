# Sub-Assistants and Orchestration

Create orchestrator assistants that coordinate multiple specialized assistants to handle complex, multi-faceted tasks. This hierarchical approach enables effective agent-to-agent communication and task delegation.

## Overview

The multi-assistant capability allows you to build an orchestrator assistant that utilizes other assistants as tools. The orchestrator intelligently delegates specific tasks to specialized sub-assistants based on the request context.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                     | Description                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Orchestrator Assistant**  | Primary assistant that coordinates and delegates tasks to sub-assistants |
| **Sub-assistants**          | Specialized assistants added as tools to the orchestrator                |
| **Hierarchical Processing** | Complex tasks broken down and distributed to appropriate specialists     |
| **Context Sharing**         | Sub-assistants access chat history to build on previous interactions     |

## Configure an Orchestrator

### Create the Orchestrator

1. Navigate to **Assistants** → **Project Assistants**.

2. Click **+ Create Assistant**.

3. Fill in basic properties:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for the orchestrator
   - **Description**: Explain the orchestrator's coordination role
   - **System Instructions**: Detailed instructions on when to use each sub-assistant

### Add Sub-assistants

1. Scroll down to the **Tools** section.

2. Locate the **Sub-assistant** field with dropdown menu.

3. Use the search function to find assistants to add as sub-assistants:

:::warning Restrictions

- Only assistants within the same project can be added
- Cannot select assistants that already have sub-assistants (no nesting)
- Cannot select the assistant itself as a sub-assistant
  :::

## Configuration Best Practices

### 1. System Instructions

The orchestrator requires detailed instructions to determine which sub-assistant to use for each task:

- Describe each sub-assistant's capabilities and specialization
- Define clear criteria for when to delegate to specific sub-assistants
- Include examples of request types that match each sub-assistant

### 2. Sub-assistant Descriptions

Each sub-assistant needs a clear description explaining:

- Its purpose and specialized capabilities
- Types of tasks it handles best
- Any limitations or constraints

### 3. Context Management

Sub-assistants can access chat history, enabling them to:

- Build upon previous interactions
- Maintain conversation continuity
- Reference earlier information without re-explanation

## Example Use Case

### Test Documentation Orchestrator

Create an orchestrator for test documentation and regression planning with three specialized sub-assistants:

| Sub-assistant           | Purpose                                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Checklist Generator** | Creates checklists based on user stories                              |
| **Test Case Writer**    | Generates manual functional test cases                                |
| **Regression Analyzer** | Analyzes code changes and provides regression testing recommendations |

**How it works:**

1. User requests test documentation help
2. Orchestrator analyzes the request type
3. Delegates to appropriate sub-assistant(s)
4. Coordinates responses into coherent answer

## View Configuration

To see which sub-assistants are configured:

1. Open the orchestrator assistant details.
2. Review the **Sub-assistants** section in the configuration panel.
3. See the complete list of available sub-assistants and their descriptions.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Specialization**: Create focused sub-assistants with clear, distinct capabilities
2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed orchestrator instructions defining delegation logic
3. **Descriptive Naming**: Use names that clearly indicate each sub-assistant's purpose
4. **Testing**: Test the orchestrator with various scenarios to verify proper delegation
5. **Documentation**: Document each sub-assistant's role for team members

:::tip Effective Orchestration
The key to successful orchestration is clear boundaries between sub-assistant responsibilities. Avoid overlapping capabilities that could confuse the orchestrator's delegation logic.
