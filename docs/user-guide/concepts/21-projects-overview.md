# 2.1 Projects Overview

The first thing that users must create when onboarding on AI/RunTM CodeMie is "Project". In AI/RunTM CodeMie, the concept of "Project" is introduced to delineate and isolate working environments, ensuring that users' activities do not interfere with one another.

These entities, designed to be created by team leaders or AI/RunTM CodeMie administrators, facilitate a structured approach to project management within the platform.

:::note
Should there be a need for a new project, team members are encouraged to contact their project management personnel.
