# Using MCP Tools in Assistants

Once configured, your assistant can use tools from the MCP server:

1. The assistant automatically discovers available tools from the MCP server
2. Users can invoke these tools through the assistant interface
3. Tool responses are formatted and presented to the user
4. If connection issues occur, the assistant provides appropriate error messages

## Troubleshooting MCP Server Connections

If you encounter issues with MCP servers:

- Verify the server URL and authentication are correct
- Check that the MCP server is operational and accessible
- Ensure network connectivity between CodeMie and the MCP server
- Review environment variable configurations
