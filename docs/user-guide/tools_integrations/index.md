# Integrations and Tools

Tools and integrations extend the functionality of AI/Run CodeMie. Tools are features that enable your Assistant to perform different tasks. While some tools operate independently within the platform, most tools require integration with external systems.

Integration is a secure way to store credentials and necessary information for further connection to external services or systems. They allow your Assistant to interact with third-party platforms such as code repositories, Jira, email, and more. By storing access credentials (e.g., URLs, tokens) or any other settings encrypted securely, integrations ensure that your Assistant can perform tasks requiring authentication without exposing critical information.

## Overview

This section covers:

### [Integrations](./integrations/)
