# 4.1 Workflows Overview

AI/Run CodeMie allows you to design complex logic for interactions between assistants, enabling the creation of fully functional workflows. By executing a series of actions, users can create their own low-code pipelines to handle a wide variety of tasks. Workflows can be found under the **Workflows** tab at the left of the screen:

## Workflows Categories

- **My Workflows**: Your personal workflows that you own or manage.
- **All Workflows**: A complete list of workflows available for you to use.
- **Templates**: Ready-made templates for quickly creating and customizing new workflows.
