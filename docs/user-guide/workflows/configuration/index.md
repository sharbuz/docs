# Workflow YAML Configuration Reference

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for configuring **CodeMie Workflows** using YAML. CodeMie Workflows is a powerful orchestration system that enables you to create complex, multi-step AI-powered processes by coordinating multiple assistants, tools, and custom processing nodes. Built on top of LangGraph (a framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications), workflows transform simple linear AI interactions into sophisticated, automated processes.

## Key Concepts

### What Makes Workflows Powerful?

- **Task Decomposition**: Break complex problems into manageable steps
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute multiple operations concurrently
- **Conditional Logic**: Branch execution based on results
- **Context Sharing**: Maintain state across all workflow steps
- **Tool Integration**: Connect to cloud platforms, databases, and APIs
- **Memory Management**: Automatic summarization for long-running processes

### When to Use Workflows

**Use workflows when:**

- Tasks require multiple distinct steps
- You need to process multiple items in parallel
- Different steps require different AI configurations
- Conditional logic based on intermediate results is needed
- Context must be preserved across multiple steps

**Use single assistants when:**

- The task can be completed in one interaction
- No parallelization or complex branching is needed
- Maximum flexibility for AI to determine its own approach

## Getting Help

- Review the documentation sections above
- Check [Complete Examples](./examples) for common patterns
- Consult [Best Practices](./best-practices) for optimization tips
- See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) for common issues
