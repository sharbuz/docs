# Exporting Workflow Execution

This functionality allows you to export information about the execution steps of a workflow as a zip archive containing Markdown or HTML files. Each file includes details about a specific step and its status.

## Export Current Execution

After a workflow has finished running:

1. Locate and click the **Export as** button on the execution page.

2. Choose your preferred export format (Markdown or HTML).

3. Optionally, check **Combine results into a single file** to merge all steps into one file instead of separate files.

:::tip
When you combine results into a single file, the zip archive will contain one consolidated file instead of a folder with multiple files.

## Export Previous Executions

To export a previous workflow execution:

1. Navigate to your workflow and click on its card.

2. Find the execution you want to export in the execution history.

3. Click the **Download** button for that execution.

4. Select your preferred format and click **Export**.

## Archive Structure

The system automatically generates a zip archive containing the exported data. Once generated, the archive will be available for download immediately.

### Archive Naming

The archive follows this naming pattern:

```
workflow_name_execution_datetime_execution_id.zip
```

Where:

- `workflow_name` - The name of the workflow
- `execution_datetime` - The date and time of execution
- `execution_id` - The unique identifier for the execution

### File Structure

Inside the archive, each execution step is represented by a separate file:

**Standard file naming:**

```
step_name_status.md
```

Where:

- `step_name` - The name of the step
- `status` - The execution status (e.g., "success" or "failed")

**Repeated steps naming:**

If a step runs multiple times, the file includes an iteration number:

```
step_name_iteration_number_status.md
```

Examples: `ProcessData_1_success.md`, `ProcessData_2_failed.md`

### Example

:::note

- Ensure that the workflow execution has been completed before exporting.

- The archive will be available for download immediately after it is generated.

- File and archive names strictly follow the defined naming conventions to simplify analysis and archiving.
