# Workflows Overview

AI/Run CodeMie allows you to design complex logic for interactions between assistants, enabling the creation of fully functional workflows. By executing a series of actions, users can create their own low-code pipelines to handle a wide variety of tasks.

## Accessing Workflows

Navigate to the **Workflows** tab in the left sidebar:

## Workflow Categories

Workflows are organized into three main categories:

| Category          | Description                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **My Workflows**  | Your personal workflows that you own or manage                      |
| **All Workflows** | A complete list of workflows available for you to use               |
| **Templates**     | Ready-made templates for quickly creating and customizing workflows |

- **Rerun**: Restart the workflow execution
- **Abort**: Stop a running execution
